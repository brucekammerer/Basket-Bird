**Basket Bird** is a fun and engaging game developed in Godot, inspired by the mechanics of the popular game Angry Birds. In this game, you launch a bird from a catapult, but instead of knocking down enemies, your goal is to hit baskets or boxes scattered throughout the level.

Each level features a specific number of boxes, and when you successfully hit one, it disappears. Your objective is to hit all the boxes using the fewest attempts possible. Each launch of the bird counts as one attempt, so aim carefully!

Challenge yourself to complete each level with the least number of tries and enjoy the satisfying gameplay of **Basket Bird**!
